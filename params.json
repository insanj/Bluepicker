{"name":"Bluepicker","tagline":"Control Bluetooth devices via Activator.","body":"Connect, disconnect, and detect Bluetooth devices via Activator.\r\n\r\nBluepicker allows you to connect and disconnect from paired devices using simple Activator actions. Choose a device from Bluepicker's selection sheet to connect or disconnect, and viola! Bluepicker also includes an Activator event, so you can assign any action you want to device connections and disconnections. Oh, and if you forgot to turn Bluetooth on before triggering, Bluepicker will handle that for you too.\r\n\r\nRequires iOS 7 and [Activator](http://rpetri.ch/cydia/activator/). Check [Releases](https://github.com/insanj/Bluepicker/releases) for current builds and screenshots.\r\n\r\n![Combo Screenie](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/951011/2132412/7bea24ee-92af-11e3-89e0-4b7ac3cac466.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
